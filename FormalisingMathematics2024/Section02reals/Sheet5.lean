`tendsTo_add` is the next challenge. In a few weeks' time I'll
maybe show you a two-line proof using filters, but right now
as you're still learning I think it's important that you
try and suffer and struggle through the first principles proof.
BIG piece of advice: write down a complete maths proof first,
with all the details there. Then, once you know the maths
proof, try translating it into Lean. Note that a bunch
of the results we proved in sheet 4 will be helpful.
